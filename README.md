# proposal-template

LaTeX proposal template package for proposals to Lowell Observatory's Discovery Channel Telescope

## Usage

Download the latest version of this package from [https://github.com/Lowell-DCT/proposal-template/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/Lowell-DCT/proposal-template/archive/master.zip).

Once unzipped, do a `make` inside the directory and, if LaTeX is installed correctly on your computer, an example proposal PDF should be generated.

## History

Developed in early 2016 by Henry Roe based on similar templates in use at KPNO/NOAO/CTIO.

2016-07-07:  Updated to shorten proposals and lessen workload on proposers & reviewers.  Changes include:
- delete abstract
- increase to 5 the number of allowed co-authors before triggering an overflow cover page
- limit science justification to one page (+ references)
- rename old "Technical Justification" section to "Observing Request Details" and clarify instructions
- delete previous use section
